Both store collections of objects accessible using a key and they hold objects of differing types

Array they key is an integer
Hashes support any object as a key

Arrays is  more efficient to access array element
Hash provide more flexibility

Note : nil is an object just like any others
and nil means false when used in the conditional expressions

Ruby hashes are similar to arrays jut must supply two objects for every entry
	key => value
